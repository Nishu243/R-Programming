# Normalized data
The word “normalization” is used informally in statistics, and so the term normalized data can have multiple meanings. In most cases, when you normalize data you eliminate the units of measurement for data, enabling you to more easily compare data from different places.
# Differential_expression_analysis
Differential expression analysis means taking the normalised read count data and performing statistical analysis to discover quantitative changes in expression levels between experimental groups.
